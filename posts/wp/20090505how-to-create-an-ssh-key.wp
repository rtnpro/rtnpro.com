OpenSSH is needed to be installed in the system to create an ssh key. Generally, OpenSSH comes with Fedora. But, anyways you can do:

</p><blockquote>$ yum install openssh</blockquote>

to install it.



Once it is installed, do the following :

<blockquote>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa</blockquote>

You will be prompted to enter the location to store the ssh key files, press Enter for default. The default location is

<blockquote>~/.ssh/id_rsa</blockquote>

Then you will be asked to enter the passphrase. Be careful, choose a passphrase that you can remember, otherwise you will not be able to recover your key. In that case you have to create a new key.



By default, your new private and public keys will be stored in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> and <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>, respectively.



You can share the public key openly, but keep the private key a secret. The public key is used by server administrators to grant you access.
