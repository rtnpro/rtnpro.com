<html><body><p>This summer I am working on building a GUI for easy setup of a completely offline Fedora repository as a part of my DGPLUG summer training 2009. This, if successfully implemented, will greatly help us to spread Fedora and FOSS usage in areas where decent internet connections are not available in general.



I am being mentored by<strong> mbuf</strong> in this project. He gave a COOL name to this project

</p><blockquote><em><strong>FedX</strong></em></blockquote>

The project tree has been created at <a href="http://gitorious.org/fedx">http://gitorious.org/fedx</a>



Also, the project <a href="http://wiki.dgplug.org/index.php?title=Fedora_offline_repo_setup">wiki </a>will be kept updated.</body></html>
