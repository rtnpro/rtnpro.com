<strong>How do you setup Transifex?</strong>



Here is all you need to know to setup Transifex: <a href="http://help.transifex.net/server/install.html">http://help.transifex.net/server/install.html</a>



<a href="http://fosswithme.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/setup-transifex-in-virtualenv/">http://fosswithme.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/setup-transifex-in-virtualenv/</a> is another good write-up on how to setup and run Transifex in virtualenv. So, I'd be building on top of that to show you how to start testing Transifex using django-nose.



<strong>What packages will you need?</strong>



django-nose, nose, nose-exclude, coverage



You can install the above packages using



<code>pip install &lt;package_name&gt;</code>



Configure Transifex settings to enable django-nose Test Runner



<code>cd &lt;transifex source code's root directory&gt;</code>



cd transifex/settings



cp  90-local.conf.sample 90-local.conf



open and edit 90-local.conf and add the following lines:



<code>INSTALLED_APPS += [</code>



'django_nose',



]



TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'



cd ..



Now, save the file. Now you are good to go.



<strong>Start testing</strong>



<code>python manage.py test &lt;app_name&gt;

</code>

for example:



<code>python manage.py test resources

</code>

You can also test a particular test class like below:



<code>python manage.py test resources.tests:TestJavaProperties</code>



You can even run a particular test method:



<code>python manage.py test resources.tests:TestJavaProperties.test_properties_parser

</code>

<strong>Run coverage on Transifex tests</strong>



django-nose has a plugin for coverage. So, you can run the above tests and collect coverage data.



For example:



<code>python manage.py test resources.tests:TestJavaProperties.test_properties_parser --with-coverage --cover-package=resources.tests.formats</code>



All the coverage results are saved in a .coverge file by default in the current directory. Although, running tests with coverage plugin of django-nose shows the coverage results by default. You can also see the coverage results in the usual way:



<code>coverage -rm</code>



You can also use grep along with the above command to filter the results displayed.



Well, that's all you need to know to start testing Transifex.



<strong>What's next?</strong>



Start testing transifex. If you find a test fails, try to find the reason why it failed. Read the traceback info properly. Find where the error took place. There are various reasons why a test may fail:

</p><ul><li>Test is not updated according to updates in code</li>

	<li>Bug in code</li>

	<li>A wrong test case</li>

</ul>

and others...



You can report the issues or any bug you find at <a href="http://trac.transifex.org/newticket">http://trac.transifex.org/newticket.</a> Feel free to submit a patch that fixes the issue. The patch will be reviewed by the Transifex upstream and if it is ok, it will be merged with Transifex's code at <a href="http://code.indifex.com/transifex/">http://code.indifex.com/transifex/</a>.
