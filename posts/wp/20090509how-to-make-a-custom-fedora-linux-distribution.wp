</p><blockquote><img title="Icon" src="http://osnews.com/images/icons/61.gif" alt="Icon" align="left">PCPlus has a <a href="http://www.pcplus.co.uk/node/3020">tutorial on building your own Linux distribution with the customizations you want</a>, derived from Fedora, using the graphical interface called Revisor.  <em>"We're used to thinking of Linux distributions being set in stone. They're either KDE or Gnome, use a certain kernel and bundle certain applications. But this doesn't have to be the case. If you find yourself making the same adjustments each time you install a new distribution, it's worth creating your own customised version. Revisor is a tool that lets you do just this, and in this tutorial, we'll show you how."</em></blockquote></body></html>
