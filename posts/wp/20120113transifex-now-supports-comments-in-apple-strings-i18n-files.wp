<html><body><p>#Transifex now supports comments in Apple .strings i18n files. Only /* foo */ style comment in the line preceding the key value pair in the source file is saved as a comment for the key. The example below will explain this in a better way:



[sourcecode]

/*Comment for key1*/

"key1" = "value 1";



/* This comment will not be

included in key2*/



/* comment for

key2*/

"key2" = "value 2";



/* this comment will not be included in key3*/



"key3" = "value 3";


~~~~~~~~~~~~


Well, I'm pretty sure that the above snippet explains which comments from source Apple .strings file are saved by Transifex. You can see the comment for a source string in its "Details" section in Lotte.
