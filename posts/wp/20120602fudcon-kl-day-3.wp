<html><body><p>The 3rd day of FUDCON KL started a bit sluggishly for me. May be because of brainstorming and hacking till late night. We (Kushal, Soumya and me) decided to work on a new app to display system logs in a user friendly manner. We named the application <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/tlogt"><strong>Tower log tower</strong></a>, in short, <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/tlogt">tlogt</a>, after Twin towers of Kuala Lumpur ;)



During the first few hours of the day, we went to visit some tourist spots in Kuala Lumpur: <a href="www.aquariaklcc.com/">Aquaria</a> and <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas_Towers">Petronas towers</a>. After we returned, we settled down for the on going talks. Amidst of various talks on the 3rd day of FUDCON, I was sometimes in listening mode, but for most time I was in coding mode. We decided to try something different in TlogT. The UI would be rendered by a Django daemon with all the WOW factor of HTML, CSS and JS. I was to code the Django server code, while Kushal and Soumya were working on writing the parsers for extracting the logs for various processes. In a few hours, we had a decent Django based functional desktop app ready. Although, quite some work remains to be done on the UI part.



There was Kushal's session on Python for newbies in the afternoon. It's always nice to see Kushal talk on Python. I don't have the exact count, but I am sure that Python sessions by Kushal inspired many (including me and my friends) to start coding in Python. The ending keynote for the day was given by Abu Mansur Manaf. This should really boost newbies to become contributors :)



I spent the evening in the hotel room listening about various functional programming languages and features of the languages from hircus and Kushal. Later, we went out for dinner with the rest of the event crew members to a local food joint. I stayed up at night to see off other Kushal, Soumya and others who had to catch an early morning flight back to India. After bidding them good bye, I packed my bags and went to sleep.</p></body></html>
