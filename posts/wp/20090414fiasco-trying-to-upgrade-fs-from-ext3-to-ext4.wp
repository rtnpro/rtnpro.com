<html><body><p>It was afternoon when I tried my hands on trying to upgrade my filesysten from ext3 to ext4. I referred to :

</p><blockquote>http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Ext4_Howto#Converting_an_ext3_filesystem_to_ext4</blockquote>

As mentioned... I did the following :



<code style="white-space:nowrap;color:#495988;background-color:white;"># tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/<em>VolGroup00/LogVol00</em></code>



<code style="white-space:nowrap;color:#495988;background-color:white;"># e2fsck -fD /dev/<em>VolGroup00/LogVol00</em></code>



<em>After quite some time, the procedure finally completed. I was so delighted that I did a sytem reboot to find that my system won't boot. The reason, I didn't update my kernel ramdisk image, and it tried to mount the / partition as ext3 and failed as the partition has already become ext4. What I forgot to do was :</em>

<blockquote><em>#mv /boot/initrd-'uname -r'.img /boot/initrd-'uname -r'.img.bak</em></blockquote>

<em>// this is to keep a backup of the existing initrd image</em>

<blockquote><em>#mkinitrd -v --with=ext4 /boot/initrd-'uname -r'.img 'uname -r'</em></blockquote>

<em>Also the following line in /etc/fstab :</em>



<em>UUID=fd296dfc-e7b3-4dc9-adf9-0038631d9c1f /                       ext3    defaults        1 1</em>



<em>needed to be updated as :</em>



<em>UUID=fd296dfc-e7b3-4dc9-adf9-0038631d9c1f /                       ext4    defaults        1 1

</em>



<em>But, I was a bit hasty. I tried to correct this issue. I booted my system from the F11-Beta installed in my pocket hard drive. I learnt how to mount an LVM partition:</em>

<blockquote><em>#vgchange -ay</em>



<em>#mount /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 &lt;mount point&gt;</em></blockquote>

<em>I tried updating the initrd images in the mounted LVM partition to find that the kernel modules for the particular kernel version of the initrd image was not found. As F11-Beta was running on a newer kernel. Tried to update the initrd images on other similar system as mine, copied the respective files in /boot and pasted it in my /boot folder and I tried to boot. It didn't boot and gave an error message saying :</em>

<blockquote><em>cannot mount /dev/root to /sysroot</em></blockquote>

<em>Any suggestions?
