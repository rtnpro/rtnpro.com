I arrived at Hotel Sri Petaling at around 3 AM on May 18, 2012. After very less sleep, I woke up at 6:30 AM. After having our breakfast at the hotel, we left for <a href="http://www.ucti.edu.my/">UCTI</a> (the venue for FUDCON KL) in a bus arranged by the FUDCON KL organizers. After reaching the venue, we got ourselves registered at the registration booth for FUDCON and we received our coupons for lunch and tea. It didn't take long for the other attendees to arrive at the venue.



The first day of FUDCON began with a key note speech by <a href="http://www.christoph-wickert.de/">Christoph Wickert</a> on "Leadership in leaderless organizations" and how this is in action in Fedora.

After the keynote, it was time for the  bar camp. Although, many were skeptical about barcamp in the 1st day of a FUDCon, it turned out to be awesome. Many a people pitched their topics for the bar camp. Among others, I also pitched two topics:

<ul><li>Transifex: A developer's perspective</li>

	<li>Agile system tests in Django</li>

</ul>

Since there were a lot of topics proposed and there was limited time, the topics were shortlisted based on votes by the attendees. One of my pitched topics: <em><strong>"Agile system tests using Django"</strong></em> finally made it into the shortlist. The bar camp sessions were scheduled to start at 2:30 PM. Over lunch, I was having some nice conversation with <a href="http://kushaldas.in/">Kushal</a>, <a href="http://hircus.wordpress.com/">Michel</a> and <a href="http://soumya.dgplug.org/">Soumya</a> on various topics related to Open Source and the LUG related activities in our places.



Among the many interesting lighting talks I managed to attend some (though not all) talks: Improving collaboration with other open source projects, Fedora for students, Git, Fedora and packages, etc. I had my talk at 4 PM. I spoke on:

<ul><li>System tests are needed</li>

	<li>Why we need fast system tests?</li>

	<li>How the Django test framework makes system tests slow?</li>

	<li>How can we remove unnecessary overheads?</li>

	<li>How we run faster system tests at Transifex?</li>

</ul>

For this, I used this <a href="http://blog.transifex.com/2012/05/faster-system-tests/">post</a> from <a href="blog.transifex.com">blog.transifex.com</a>.



It was an awesome 1st day of FUDCON KL. I participated in my first bar camp and it turned out to be a lot of fun and exciting. We had some post-event chats and discussions while leaving the venue. I also had some long conversation with <a href="http://www.atmayogi.com/taxonomy/term/11/0">Joshua Wulf</a> while heading back to the hotel on matters related to spirituality. This was an eye opener and I had many of my doubts resolved by the grace of an elevated devotee like him.



So, it was an enlightening day for me, both in terms of FOSS and spirituality.</body></html>
