<html><body><p>We were facing a lot of difficulties in setting up Fedora after the installation. Reason? Poor internet connection in the locality. It was a great dissatisfaction for me and Kishan (my friend) and also for the newbies. To resolve this, Arindam Ghosh gave me a copy of "Fedora-mirror" and taught me the How-Tos to setup an offline Fedora-mirror and do the requisite installations. It was really a needed gift for us. We set-up many a system successsfully with its help.



Then I thought of trying to automate this process. So, I started writing shell scripts. My idea was simple. Take a backup of the contents of <strong>yum.repos.d</strong> and place the local repository files in yum.repos.d. Start the ftp server (<strong>vsftpd</strong>), and use the loopback (<strong>lo</strong>) interface which generally has the proxy <strong>127.0.0.1</strong>. Then provide the user with a terminal to do the requisite installations. Then exiting that terminal, turning off the ftp server and replacing the original contents of  yum.repos.d. I transferred the entire Fedora-mirror to my <strong>Maxtor-Portable</strong> hard drive.



I created 3 shell scripts - 1)mirror-setup.sh, 2)mirror-start.sh and 3)mirror-stop.sh.



The user jsut needs to invoke the mirror-setup.sh as root and he gets the terminal for doing installations. To exit the terminal, he just needs to type 'exit' and press &lt;enter&gt;. The scripts mirror-start.sh is for starting the ftp mirror and the mirro-stop.sh is for stopping the mirror. These two scripts are being called by the mirror-setup.sh. Below are the details of the scripts....



1)mirror-setup.sh===================================================================

</p><blockquote>#!/bin/sh



cd /media/My\ storage/fedora-mirror/



sh ./mirror-start.sh

echo You are now ready to install packages offline...To  quit...enter 'exit'

su -

sh /media/My\ storage/fedora-mirror/mirror-stop.sh

echo Local Fedora-mirror stopped...</blockquote>

2)mirror-start.sh=====================================================================

<blockquote>#!/bin/sh



/etc/init.d/vsftpd start



mkdir /tmp/yum.repos.bak

mv /etc/yum.repos.d/* /tmp/yum.repos.bak/



cd ~



mount --bind /media/My\ storage/fedora-mirror/ /var/ftp/pub/



cd /etc/yum.repos.d/



wget -ivh ftp://127.0.0.1/pub/yum/*</blockquote>

3)mirror-stop.sh=====================================================================

<blockquote>#!/bin/sh



rm  /etc/yum.repos.d/*

mv /tmp/yum.repos.bak/* /etc/yum.repos.d/



rm -r /tmp/yum.repos.bak</blockquote>
