<html><body><p>Lately, I have been working on adding new features to <strong>wordgroupz</strong> like dictionary support, wiktionary support, pronunciation support. I  have also made some changes to the <strong>wordgroupz</strong> gui optimized for  the new features.

<div>The dictionary support features online dict.org webster dictionary  and a offline wordnet dictionary. I used the server interface to  retrieve definitions from it.</div>

<div>I used the nltk library to retrieve definitions from wordnet  dicitionary database.</div>

<div>I implemented the wiktionary support using webkit, BeautifulSoup  and urllib2. Pronunciations if availale on wiktionary are allowed to be  downloaded.</div>

<div>The new interface looks like this below:</div>

<div><img src="http://rtnpro.fedorapeople.org/Screenshot-wordGroupz-1.png" alt=""></div>

<div>Due to the frequent changes made in the <strong>wordgroupz</strong> repository atÂ <a href="http://gitorious.org/wordgroupz/wordgroupz/trees/master">http://gitorious.org/<strong>wordgroupz</strong>/<strong>wordgroupz</strong>/trees/master</a>,  I have not been able to update the setup.py, README, etc. files. I also  added a nltk*tar.gz in the src folder, that looks weird. I will be  cleaning up the repository.</div>

<div>For the time being, to test the code, follow the following steps:</div>

<div>1) download the src code</div>

<div>2) do not install it via setup.py</div>

<div>3) extract the nltk*.tar.gz and install the nltk python module from  the setup.py inside nltk.</div>

<div>4) install pywebkitgtk</div>

<div>5) Now run the new interface using wordgroupz_new.py</div>

<div>All the previous features have not been ported to the  wordgroupz_new.py, which I wrote while coding for the wiktionary  support. I will updating the file soon.</div>

<div>Please give your valuable feedback for improvements.</div>
