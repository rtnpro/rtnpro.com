<html><body><p>For some time, I have been hanging around with django. I got some cool video tutorials on the web on django. They helped me a lot to start coding in django. At the same time, I was also going through the Transifex source code. After some time, I browsed through the tickets in<a href="trac.transifex.org"> trac.transifex.org</a> and started with fixing ticket <a href="http://trac.transifex.org/ticket/679">#679</a>.



I had to go through javascript, jquery, html in addition to write the <a href="http://trac.transifex.org/attachment/ticket/679/ticket679.patch">patch</a> for #679. I also wrote a custom pagination plugin for <a href="http://www.datatables.net/plug-ins/pagination">dataTables pagination</a> for fixing the issue mentioned in ticket #679. I submitted the patch upstream for review. I hope it will be accepted.



After that Diego directed me to work on ticket <a href="http://trac.transifex.org/ticket/129">#129</a>. Here I had add the provision for a "Remember me" option, which, if selected during login, will set the login duration to 21 days, else, the login session will expire on browser close. I had to create a form class _AuthenticationForm subclassing django's AuthenticationForm to add a new Boolean form field "Remember me". Then I had to just pass this _AuthenticationForm as the form argument in simpleauth.views.login and call simpleauth.views.login when the url is of the pattern r'^accounts/login/$'. Yeah ... I know this looks odd.



But the best thing about this is that, it works both for simpleauth and for django-profiles. Also, when django-profile is being used, the django-profile templates are used. I have tested this <a href="http://trac.transifex.org/attachment/ticket/129/ticket129.patch">patch</a> on my system, its working fine. I hope the upstream will accept this.</p></body></html>
