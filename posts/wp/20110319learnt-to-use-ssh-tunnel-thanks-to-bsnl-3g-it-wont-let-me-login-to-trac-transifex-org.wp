<html><body><p>For some days, I was not able to login to trac.transifex.org. I though that it might be a browser issue. So, I deleted the browser data and tried to login using firefox, opera and google-chrome, but I still couldn't login.



Then, I established an ssh tunnel from my computer to a remote server and set up proxy settings in my browser to use the ssh tunnel. And now, I can login correctly. This shows that it is not a browser issue but a connection issue.

I think something is terribly wrong with BSNL 3G servers and their maintainers.



Similarly, koji-client does not work over BSNL 3G. I have been tired complaining to the BSNL 3G Customer Care about this issue. But they don't understand the issue only and issue is never solved.</p></body></html>
