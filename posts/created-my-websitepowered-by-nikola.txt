Finally, I have created my first portfolio cum blog website at
`www.rtnpro.com <http://www.rtnpro.com/>`_. I used
`Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_ for this.

The theme for the website uses the theme of `Twitter bootstrap
<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ as it's base. A cool thing
about my home page is that the projects section is dynamically
generated using `MyGithubProjects <https://github.com/rtnpro/MyGithubProjects>`_
to show the projects that I work on in Github: projects those I own and
upstream projects I contribute to. So, I need not maintain the list of
projects any more for my portfolio ;)

It took me some time to integrate MyGithubProjects as task in Nikola
to generate the home page from a custom template. Also, playing with
styling for the page was fun. After putting all this time and effort,
it seems pretty good enough to satiate me.

You can find the code for my website `here <https://github.com/rtnpro/rtnpro.com>`_.
