Hi! I am Ratnadeep Debnath. I am also known as rtnpro. I am a FOSS developer and evangelist. I work as a Software Engineer at Goibibo. I also contribute to various open source projects like Fedora, Mozilla, Ankur Bangla, etc. I also have a deep interest in spirituality and scriptures. In my spare time, I like to try my luck with cooking :)

Experience
***************
Software Engineer at Goibibo, February 2013 to Present
======================================================
I work on the Flight component at `Goibibo <https://www.goibibo.com>`_. I also
integrate new technologies to streamline our workflow. Refactoring and improving
code to make it more readable, optimized, unittest ready along with with exhaustive tests is also a part of the job.

Software Developer and QA at Transifex , September 2011 â€“ January 2013
======================================================================
At Transifex, I develop new features, enhance existing ones and implement support for various i18n file formats. I also write tests to ensure that things run as they are expected to. User support, bug triagging and bug fixing is also a part of my job. At Transifex, we innovate to take localization to the next level. Below are a few things(among many) that I have done so far at Transifex:

- Implement and enhance file format handlers.
- Implemented Glossary feature.
- Implemented related tag cloud.
- Implemented translation strings API.
- Implemented a super fast test suite.
- Fix and update tests.
- Bug-triagging & bug-fixing.
- Handle user queries and bug reports at support.transifex.com and over live chat at Transifex.

Summer Intern at Transifex , June 2011 - August 2011
====================================================
It was an awesome experience to work as an Intern at Indifex. I got introduced to a plethora of new technologies all of a sudden. I went through a steep learning curve and finally it paid off. I contributed to Transifex, increased test coverage for Transifex, fixed bugs, added support for new i18n file fomats. I also worked on implementing new features for Transifex, like, Glossary, tag assignment, etc.
